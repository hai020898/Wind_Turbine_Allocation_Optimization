# Wind_Turbine_Allocation_Optimization

Final Project for MGSC 662 as part of MMA program at McGill University.

For the final project, we utilized Mixed Integer Programming to optimize the allocation of wind turbine in a Canadian wind farm. The farm layout is divided to square grid and the optimization program seeks to find the optimal number and location of nodes to maximize energy output while minimizing power loss by the wake effect and maintaining the distance restriction between each turbine.

The optimization result is then compared to the real allocation of the wind farm and further future improvement is discussed to improve the efficacy of the model.
